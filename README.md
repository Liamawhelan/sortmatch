# sortmatch

A website that uses Glicko2 to run tournaments. The methodology is similar to that of a Swiss-system tournament (or a McMahon system tournament if competitors are provided non-default initial ratings), but in place of integer points for wins and losses, match results are recorded in the Glicko2 system and competitor ratings are updated accordingly.
